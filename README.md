## Why did I make this?

Fractal Encryptions have a cost, they produce items, and I want to make a profit.

A Fractal Encryption does not have a price tag attached, but there *are* price tags attached to the items given. If I wanted to know the value of the a Fractal Encryption, then I can add up all the price tags attached to the associated items. The price tags can come from the Guild Wars 2 API, so I made a table of GET requests to the API in order to calculate the profit margin for a Fractal Encryption.

## Something to note

The GW2 API updates every 5 minutes, so all the cells in the table do not change constantly.
